**Description**

The adult dataset was collected from the US Census Bureau and the primary task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50K a year based attributes such as education, hours of work per week, etc. the target feature is *income*, a factor with levels "<=50K" and ">50K", and the remaining

14 variables are predictors.

**Usage**

df=dsf.load('adult')

**Format**

The adult dataset, as a data frame, contains 48598 rows and 15 columns (variables/features).

The 15 variables are:

- age: age in years.

*Bank marketing data set*

**Description**

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. the marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. the classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable deposit).

**Usage**

df=dsf.load('bank')

**Format**

The bank dataset, as a data frame, contains 4521 rows (customers) and 17 columns (variables/features).

The 17 variables are:

Bank client data:

- age: numeric.
- job: type of job; categorical: "admin.", "unknown", "unemployed", "management", "housemaid", "entrepreneur", "student", "blue-collar, "self-employed", "retired", "technician", "services".
- marital: marital status; categorical: "married", "divorced", "single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed.
- education: categorical: "secondary", "primary", "tertiary", "unknown".
- default: has credit in default?; binary: "yes","no".
- balance: average yearly balance, in euros; numeric.
- housing: has housing loan? binary: "yes", "no".
- loan: has personal loan? binary: "yes", "no".

Related with the last contact of the current campaign:

- contact: contact: contact communication type; categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular".
- day: last contact day of the month; numeric.
- month: last contact month of year; categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec".

- pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign; numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted.
- previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client; numeric.
- poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign; categorical: "success", "failure", "unknown", "other".

Target variable:

\section{redwines}
\vspace{-1.5em} 
\hrulefill

*Red wines data set*

**Description**

The redWines datasets are related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). The dataset can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. the classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.


**Usage**

df=dsf.load('redwines')

**Format**

The redWines dataset, as a data frame, contains 1599 rows and 12 columns (variables/features). 

The 12 variables are:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data)

- quality: score between 0 and 10.
