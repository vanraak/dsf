The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese
banking institution. the marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.
Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order

subscribed. the classification goal is to predict if the client will
subscribe a term deposit (variable deposit).

**Description**

The redWines datasets are related to red variants of the Portuguese
“Vinho Verde” wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only
physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are
available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine
selling price, etc.). The dataset can be viewed as classification or
regression tasks. the classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there
are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier
detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor
wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it
could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

**Usage**

df=dsf.load(‘redwines’)

**Format**

The redWines dataset, as a data frame, contains 1599 rows and 12 columns
(variables/features).

The 12 variables are:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

-   fixed_acidity
-   volatile_acidity
-   citric_acid
-   residual_sugar
-   chlorides
-   free_sulfur_dioxide
-   total_sulfur_dioxide
-   density
-   pH
-   sulphates
-   alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data)

-   quality: score between 0 and 10.
